# Gameplay Ideas

Preliminary notes on the gameplay aspects of a (yet untitled) Zero-Player Game
coursework project. 

We drew inspiration for the game concept from [Godville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godville).
The setting is loosely based on J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, although
we allowed ourselves to freely incorporate references to other media as well.

## Overview

### Concept

When using the term zero-player game, we refer to a specific definition
where the human player has no _direct_ influence on the actions of game characters;
the latter may progress with no user interaction at all past their creation.

Multiple players coexist in the same world. __The way players interact is yet to be discussed__.

The interface is text-based.

### Setting

The game takes place within a high-school building with a large but finite number
of classrooms. The building is full of aggressive creatures who guard the halls
and show an apparent dislike for passersby. Classrooms are the only places safe
from monsters, but students who don't dare to step outside of one quickly get
expelled: after all, their classes are spread all over the building, and they've
got attendance to keep up.

### Player's Role

The player takes up a role of a _ghost_, a supernatural entity that is
assigned to every student who enrolls in the school. Some can be likened to
guarding angels, while others are more of personal demonds â€” that depends on
the player's wishes.

A ghost can't physically control the student, but it can affect the environment.
If the ghost gets lucky, the student will pick subtle clues and follow them,
attributing their successes to intuition and luck. At the same time, there is
no guarantee that the actions of the ghost will get noticed at all.

### Player's Controls

__(The controls are yet to be designed).__ There are several requirements:

Firstly, they need to be abstract enough to suit all game situations without
the need for manual relabelling. Think of how choices are presented in visual
novels as an example of what we _do not_ want: they are specific to a
particular location, character, time, etc.

Secondly, performing a certain action needs to have an element of surprise
and randomness to it. The player should never be completely certain
of the outcome (otherwise, we risk making the gameplay dull and repetitive),
but at the same time, the actions should carry enough meaning so that
choosing the "right" one is quite possible.

### Game Progression

Every student has to get through 7 years of tough subjects, strict teachers,
and dangerous creatures of the hallways... On top of that, advancing to the
next year takes more than remaining alive: each subject in the study plan
needs to be passed. Passing is directly linked to attendance __(what happens
when the requirement is not met is yet to be discussed)__.

Students get better at beating the monsters when moving from classroom
to classroom by discovering new spells and finding information about specific
creatures from _books_ available in the school library. The library is very
strict about who can touch its catalog, though (see the
[Acquiring Books](#acquiring-books) section).

Studying and slaying monsters eventually becomes a daily routine, and to keep
students from getting bored, teachers organize various events __(the exact
nature of events is yet to be discussed)__.

## Mechanics

### Character Creation

The player has three parameters to fill in for the student their ghost character
will be assigned to. The first two, name and gender, have no effect on the game
progression. The third one, _personal value_, influences certain mechanics
__(yet to be discussed)__.

### Books

Books are the primary way for a student to improve its chances against
dangerous creatures and learn new spells.

#### Acquiring Books

Books are available in the school library. To get a specific book, a student
needs to have a permission from the teacher. __(It is yet to be decided if
book permissions can be obtained during classes only or defeated creatures
drop them as loot as well).__

### Creatures

Up to a certain point, a student has only two options upon encountering
a creature: fight it or run away __(?)__. The player can't make this choice,
but it can influence it __(yet to be discussed)__.

#### Fighting Creatures

__(Yet to be discussed)__.

#### Domesticating Creatures

When a student reads more than one book about a particular creature,
it gains a non-zero chance of domesticating it instead of killing.

### Spells

There are N distinct types of spells __(yet to be defined)__. A student
can keep only one spell of each type in their memory: upon discovering
a new spell, the student forgets the previous one.

Spells have a power stat __(depends on the type, has to be discussed as well)__.
The chance of encountering a book permission for a spell is inversely proportional
to its usefulness (power).

__(There's possibly a way to prevent the student from unlearning a spell
to replace it with a less powerful one, but this has yet to be discussed).__
