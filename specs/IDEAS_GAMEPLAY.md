# Gameplay Ideas

Preliminary notes on the gameplay aspects of a (yet untitled) Zero-Player Game
coursework project. 

We drew inspiration for the game concept from [Godville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godville).
The setting is loosely based on J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, although
we allowed ourselves to freely incorporate references to other media as well.

## Overview

### Concept

When using the term zero-player game, we refer to a specific definition
where the involvement of a human player is not _necessary_ for the game
characters to develop. The [role of the player](#players-role) is therefore
to _speed up_ the progress, not enable it in the first place.

The game experience is more comparable to brief interactions
with a news feed rather than conventional drawn-out game sessions.
The interface is text-based, and [the character's diary](#diary) plays
an important role in keeping the player up to date with ongoing developments.

The player's interest is constantly piqued by new gameplay mechanics
being unlocked and further possibilities being hinted at. Furthermore,
the exact kind of [controls available](#players-controls) changes
from time to time.

### Setting

The game takes place within a high-school building with a large but finite number
of classrooms. The building is full of aggressive creatures who guard the halls
and show an apparent dislike for passersby. Classrooms are the only places safe
from monsters, but students who don't dare to step outside of one quickly get
expelled: after all, their classes are spread all over the building, and they've
got attendance to keep up.

### Player's Role

The player takes up a role of a _ghost_, a supernatural entity that is
assigned to every student who enrolls in the school. Ghosts can be likened
to guardian angels, although their motives may be less than pure — and that
is up to the player.

Try as it might, a ghost can never physically control its student.
This is where owls come to the rescue...

### Player's Controls

Inside tiny cages scattered around the building, countless owls are
kept in captivity by monsters of the hallways. Students free them out of the
goodness of their hearts, not awaiting anything in return — perhaps
they simply empathize with how bleak life in captivity is.

Owls, being creatures of dignity, always repay the favor to the student's
ghost. Some of them are, for example, natural healers, and the ghost may take
advantage of that to save the student from a particularly nasty monster.

An owl only helps once, so the ghost must be careful not to spend the favors
on gratuitous whims.

### Game Progression

Every student has to get through 7 years of tough subjects, strict teachers,
and dangerous creatures of the hallways... On top of that, [advancing to the
next year](#levelling-up) takes more than remaining alive.

Students get better at beating the monsters when moving from classroom
to classroom by discovering new spells and finding information about specific
creatures from _books_ available in the school library. The library is very
[strict about who can touch its catalog](#acquiring-books), though.

Studying and slaying monsters eventually becomes a daily routine, and to keep
students from getting bored, teachers organize various [events](#events).

## Mechanics

### Diary

### Character Creation

The player has three parameters to fill in for the student their ghost character
will be assigned to. The first two, name and gender, have no effect on the game
progression. The third one, _personal value_, influences certain mechanics
__(yet to be discussed)__.

### Books

Books are the primary way for a student to improve its chances against
dangerous creatures and learn new spells.

#### Acquiring Books

Books are available in the school library. To get a specific book, a student
needs to have a permission from the teacher. __(It is yet to be decided if
book permissions can be obtained during classes only or defeated creatures
drop them as loot as well).__

### Creatures

Up to a certain point, a student has only two options upon encountering
a creature: fight it or run away __(?)__. The player can't make this choice,
but it can influence it __(yet to be discussed)__.

#### Fighting Creatures

__(Yet to be discussed)__.

#### Domesticating Creatures

When a student reads more than one book about a particular creature,
it gains a non-zero chance of domesticating it instead of killing.

### Spells

There are N distinct types of spells __(yet to be defined)__. A student
can keep only one spell of each type in their memory: upon discovering
a new spell, the student forgets the previous one.

Spells have a power stat __(depends on the type, has to be discussed as well)__.
The chance of encountering a book permission for a spell is inversely proportional
to its usefulness (power).

__(There's possibly a way to prevent the student from unlearning a spell
to replace it with a less powerful one, but this has yet to be discussed).__
